# AI Review

## How We Used AI

- To better understand the code used in class and how to correctly implement it in our project.  
- To solve complex bugs and logic errors that were difficult to handle on our own.  
- To explore and implement new features that extended beyond the original class scope.  
- To ensure proper styling, layout structure, and smooth CSS transitions throughout the site.  
- To debug rendering and performance issues in React components and improve overall responsiveness.  
- To refine component organization, state management, and variable naming for cleaner, more maintainable code.
